          <h3 class="principletitle">Contrast</h3>
          <p>Microsoft</p>
          <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/?SilentAuth=1&ql=5&wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank">www.microsoft.com</a>
          <img src="/lesson2/images/contrast_microsoft.png" alt="Mobile screenshot of microsoft webpage">
          <p>Microsoft uses the principle of contrast very nicely. You'll notice that the content is black to stand out against the stark white of the rest of the page. 
            In addition to black text on white background, you'll notice that there isn't really any other colors to draw your attention. 
            This enhances the contrast of the page and really focuses your attention on the dark buttons and the colors of their logo.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="principle2">
          <h3 class="principletitle">Repetition</h3>
          <p>The Home Depot</p>
          <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/" target="_blank">www.homedepot.com</a>
          <img src="/lesson2/images/repetition_home_depot.png" alt="Mobile screenshot of home deopt webpage">
          <p>The home depot has a very distint color associated with their stores. Their signature orange is part of their brand recognition and is featured heavily in their logo and their identity. 
            So it should come as no surprise that their website utilizes orange. However, look at how strongly it is repeated. 
            This repetition serves to enforce their brand, but also helps ground you so you always know what site you are using.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="principle3">
          <h3 class="principletitle">Fitts' Law</h3>
          <p>Princess Cruise Line</p>
          <a href="https://www.princess.com/" target="_blank">www.princess.com</a>
          <img src="/lesson2/images/fitts_princess_cruises.png" alt="Mobile screenshot of princess cruises webpage">
          <p> Princess cruise lines' webstie utilizes Fitt's law very well. You'll notice that the 'find a cruise vacation' button is fairly large and is right in the middle of the screen.
            The cruise line's intention is for you to hit that button in an almost effortless manner. It's bigger than most of the other content and is posistioned right where your finger or cursor usually resides.
            Not only is it posistioned in a great place the color of the button draws your attention directly to it, inviting you again to tap and discover all they have to offer.
