      <h2>Target Audience</h2>
      <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>My intended audience are people within the southeast Idaho area. These people are most likely locals and 
          are interested in the weather in their area. The demographics of these people vary widely so care will need to be 
          taken to appeal to all ages and education levels.
        </p>
      <h3>Persona #1</h3>
        <p>Jacob</p>
        <p>Jacob is a 59 year old male who lives in Fish Haven. He's looking forward to retirement and is starting to take an
          interest in gardening. He is trying to find local things to do to fill his time as he's trying out new hobbies.
        </p>
      <h3>Persona #2</h3>
        <p>Tara</p>
        <p>Tara is an 18 year old female who loves lame jokes. She lives in Preston and likes to know what's going on in the community around her.
          She finds it useful to have a quick overview of the weather and the activities in her area.
        </p>
      <h3>Scenarios</h3>
        <p>Scenario #1</p>
        <p>Jacob has a day off and wants to know if he will need to dress in long sleeves to protect his arms from the sun 
          or if it's going to be too hot and he should opt for his favorite wide brimmed hat. He can check the weather on 
        Such a Snow it All.</p>
        <p>Scenario #2</p>
        <p>Jacob has an interest in connecting with other gardeners in his area. He knows the weather site he just visted 
          has a community section for his local area. He can open up Such a Snow it All and find out if theres a local 
          farmer's market to attend.
        </p>
        <p>Scenario #3</p>
        <p>Tara has a weekend off of work and wants to know what's going on. She can navigate to the community tab on Such a Snow it All to 
          see that there is a non-denominational area dance. However, there's a relatively high humidity level and a chance of rain. So curling 
          her hair is probably not the best option for the dance.
        </p>
        <p>Scenario #4</p>
        <p>Tara loves 'dad' jokes and she's always competing with her father. It's really handy that her favorite local site has a 'joke of 
          the day' that is usually good quality. Such a Snow it All has a deep bank of puns, lame jokes, and weather based jokes at their disposal.
        </p>
        <p>Scenario #5</p>
        <p>Mason is considering moving to southeast Idaho from Tempe, Arizona. He isn't sure how much the weather is different from
          his current hometown. He knows he can check a local weather site to get a feel for how the weather is trending. Such a Snow it all
          is a site that can give a brief glance of the weather in the local area.</p>
